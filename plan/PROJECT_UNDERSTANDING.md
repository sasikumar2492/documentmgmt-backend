## PHARMA-DMS – Project Understanding & Data Model

### 1. Project Overview

**PHARMA-DMS** is an end-to-end, compliant Document Management and Workflow system tailored for regulated environments (e.g., pharma). It digitizes the full lifecycle of controlled documents and change requests:

- **Document intake & preparation**
  - Upload Word/Excel/PDF documents as templates.
  - Use AI-assisted parsing to extract sections and fields.
  - Generate configurable workflows based on document content and department.

- **Request creation & approval**
  - Initiate requests from published templates.
  - Capture structured, multi-page approval data.
  - Route requests through multi-step review and approval workflows.

- **Publishing, training, and effectiveness**
  - Publish approved documents as controlled versions.
  - Assign and track user trainings linked to published documents.
  - Monitor document effectiveness and support continuous improvement.

- **Governance, compliance & auditability**
  - Role-based access control.
  - Complete activity and audit logs.
  - Electronic signatures on critical actions.
  - Configurable notifications and email alerts.

The solution supports multiple user roles (Admin, Requestor, Preparator, Reviewer, Approver, Managers) with clear separation of duties, strong auditability, and traceable electronic signatures.

### 3. Major Modules & Screens (From Existing UI)

#### 3.1. Authentication & Access

- **Home Landing (`HomePage`)**
  - Public entry screen with navigation into:
    - DMS module.
    - Ticket Flow module.
    - Login screen.

- **Ticket Flow Login (`TicketFlowLogin`)**
  - Login dedicated to the “Ticket Flow” experience.
  - Used for specialized ticket-based workflows.

- **Standard Sign-In (`SignInPage`)**
  - Username/password with role selection (admin, preparator, reviewer, approver, manager variants).
  - After authentication:
    - Admin → `AdminHomeDashboard`.
    - Manager → document management.
    - Others → main `Dashboard`.

> **Authentication-required:** All main application views after sign-in (dashboard, document management, workflows, libraries, training, settings, audit, etc.) require login.

#### 3.2. Dashboards & Navigation

- **User Dashboard (`Dashboard`, `PreparatorDashboard`)**
  - Personalized view of:
    - Assigned requests and their statuses.
    - Recently uploaded templates/documents.
    - Quick links: Raise Request, Upload Templates, etc.

- **Admin Home Dashboard (`AdminHomeDashboard`)**
  - KPIs for admins:
    - Volume of requests (by status, department, time).
    - Published documents and training coverage.
    - Pending approvals and SLA breaches.
    - Quick access to admin/configuration areas.

- **Sidebars (`LeftSidebar`, `AdminSidebar`)**
  - Left navigation structure, role-aware:
    - Dashboard, document management, raise request, reports, libraries, workflows, training, analytics, admin, audit.
  - Collapsible/expandable layout.

#### 3.3. Document Templates & AI-Assisted Generation

- **Upload Templates / Document Management (`UploadTemplates`, `DocumentManagement`)**
  - **Flow (see Phase 1 plan 1.3):** Upload **.doc/.docx** only (frontend) → backend stores in **local DB** → ConvertAPI converts to **PDF** → **Gemini** converts to **HTML** → API returns **HTML** → frontend provides **editable HTML** → on save, backend reconverts HTML to .doc/.docx and updates file in **S3**.
  - Use AI (Gemini) and ConvertAPI for conversion pipeline; optional parsers/workflowGenerator for form sections and AI workflow proposal (departments, steps, sequence).
  - Display upload metadata: file name, size, department, upload date.

- **Workflow Approval for AI-Generated Flow (`WorkflowApprovalStep`)**
  - Preparator/Admin reviews AI-generated workflow:
    - Steps, departments, order.
  - Outcomes:
    - Approve → proceed to AI Conversion Preview (editable HTML).
    - Reject → return to Upload Templates to adjust/try again.

- **AI Conversion Preview (`AIConversionPreview`)**
  - **Editable HTML** view/editor: user edits the HTML returned from the backend; on save, frontend sends edited HTML to backend, which reconverts to .doc/.docx and updates S3.
  - Optionally: visual editor for AI-generated form sections and fields (refine labels, field types, required flags, department assignments).
  - Saving creates/updates a reusable **Template** entry and updates the .doc/.docx file in S3 for future requests.

#### 3.4. Request Creation & Approval Forms

- **Raise Request (`RaiseRequest`)**
  - Lists available templates.
  - User selects template and initiates a new request.

### 6. Email Notification Expectations (Business View)

From an end-user and business perspective, emails are expected in at least these scenarios:

#### 6.1. User Account & Security

- **Welcome email** on account creation.
- **Email verification** where required.
- **Password reset / forgotten password**.
- **Security alerts** (e.g., suspicious login, account lockout).

#### 6.2. Request Lifecycle

- When a **new request is submitted**:
  - Notify reviewers/approvers and relevant managers.
- When a **request is resubmitted** after revision:
  - Notify the current reviewer/approver.
- When a **request is assigned** or re-assigned:
  - Notify the assignee.
- When a **request is approved**:
  - Notify the requestor, preparator, and stakeholders.
- When a **request is rejected**:
  - Notify requestor, preparator, and possibly line manager.
- When a **request requires revision**:
  - Send email with remarks and required changes.
- When **approval is required**:
  - Notify the next approver in the workflow sequence.
- Optional escalation emails:
  - For overdue approvals or SLA breaches.

#### 6.3. Template & Document Lifecycle

- When a new **template is created/approved**:
  - Notify admins, preparators, and department leads.
- When a document is **published**:
  - Notify impacted departments and training coordinators.
- When a **new version** of a controlled document is released:
  - Notify all users bound to that document (e.g., through training assignments).
- When a document is **archived or superseded**:
  - Notify relevant stakeholders.

#### 6.4. Training & Effectiveness

- **Training assignment** emails to trainees.
- **Reminders** for pending/overdue trainings.
- **Completion confirmations** to trainees and managers.
- Alerts when **document effectiveness checks** identify issues (optional).

#### 6.5. Ticket Flow

- Ticket **creation** confirmation to ticket creator.
- Ticket **assignment** notifications to responsible agents/managers.
- Ticket **status change** notifications (in progress, resolved, closed).

#### 6.6. System & Administration

- Optional alerts to admins for:
  - High error rates in document processing (e.g., AI parsing failures).
  - Bulk user imports or configuration changes.
  - Significant audit or security events.

All of the above will later map to configurable notification events, with toggles to enable/disable emails per event and per role/user.

### 7. Database Schema Overview (Conceptual, PostgreSQL-Oriented)

This section describes the relational data model that will be implemented using PostgreSQL and Prisma, aligned with the UI and business flows. It is intentionally language-agnostic (no code) but ready to translate into migrations.

#### 7.1. Design Principles

- **Alignment with UI**
  - Tables map directly to existing frontend types and flows (`TemplateData`, `ReportData`, `TrainingRecord`, `NotificationData`, `AuditLogEntry`, `ElectronicSignature`, etc.).

- **Separation of Concerns**
  - **Master data**: users, roles, departments, templates, workflows, SOPs.
  - **Transactional data**: requests, workflow instances, remarks, trainings, tickets.
  - **Cross-cutting**: notifications, emails, audit logs, signatures, configuration.

- **Flexibility**
  - Use `jsonb` (e.g., for dynamic forms and workflow rules) where structure is flexible but must remain queryable.

- **Scalability & Compliance**
  - Explicit status tracking.
  - Complete audit trails.
  - Electronic signatures referencing audit records.
